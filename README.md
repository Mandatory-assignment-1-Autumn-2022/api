Assignment 4 REST

    Make a new project in Visual Studio, type “ASP.NET Core Web Api”

    Don’t use HTTPS
    Don’t use minimal API
    Use OpenAPI support

    Use the FootballPlayer class from Assignment 1 (don’t copy the class, but use the library as a reference)
    Create a manager class “FootballPlayersManager” 

    The Manager must have a static List with at least 4 objects.
    The Manager must assign all Ids of the FootballPlayers
    The Manager must have 5 methods (GetAll, GetByID, Add, Update and Delete)

    Create a Controller (remember to use API Controller, not MVC Controller)

    The Controller must have the 5 methods like the Manager, and then call the Manager for each of the methods
    Implement appropriate status codes for the 5 methods

    Create Unit tests for at least 2 methods from the Manager

Your REST API must be uploaded to Azure.
